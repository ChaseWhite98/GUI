        <p class="p1">I am currently a senior in the computer science major here at UML. After taking GUI, I will have finished my requirements for graduation, which is quite exciting. <br>I am completely new to the world of web development and have never coded in HTML, CSS, or javascript. So, I'm hoping that this class will provide me an opportunity to branch out from the more algorithmic side of coding and explore a more aesthetic and creative side of programming.</p>
